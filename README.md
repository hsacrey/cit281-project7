## Project 7

Here, in this project, I've created a user-level GitHub Page, and added content to this Page.

I've created repos for each of the labs and projects for the CIT 281 class.

I've also created a GitHub Page for each of the labs and projects, with images, descriptions, and code blocks.

I've also added links to the organization or user Page to each of the labs and projects.

### Primary Concepts: GitHub repos, GitHub Pages, Create an initial CIT Minor portfolio for my labs and projects

#### This is it!
